# Hotel Management API

This project provides a RESTful API for managing hotel data. The API includes endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting hotel records, as well as uploading images associated with each hotel. Images are optimized through compression, resizing, and format conversion to improve storage efficiency.

## Project Overview

The Hotel Management API allows you to manage hotel data, including adding new hotels, retrieving hotel details, updating hotel information, and deleting hotels. Additionally, images associated with each hotel can be uploaded and optimized through compression, resizing, and format conversion for efficient storage and fast access.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests using Jest and Supertest to test API endpoints and functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute all test cases, including validation for endpoints like `POST /hotel/images` and `DELETE /hotel/:hotelId`.

## Image Optimization

When images are uploaded to the API, they are processed for optimization. The steps include:

1. **Compression**: Images are compressed to reduce file size.
2. **Resizing**: Images are resized to specified dimensions, maintaining a balance between quality and file size.
3. **Format Conversion**: Uploaded images are converted to `JPEG` format if they are not already, further reducing file size.

These optimizations are done using the [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library, which provides high-performance image processing capabilities.
